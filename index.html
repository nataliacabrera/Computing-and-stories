        <h1>Computing & Stories</h1>

            <p>We are excited to announce the first Computing and Stories Summit at the School for Poetic Computation, co-organized by Linda Liukas and Taeyoon Choi, featuring Amy Wibowo, Jie Qi, Jenna Register, and Natalie Freed. We’d like to invite the wider community to explore following questions through workshops and presentations:</p>

            <p>How can we illustrate complex technical concepts through playful and inviting visuals? How can we contribute to a culture of engineering and science that’s respectful and inviting to women, people of color, disabled persons, and the LGBTQ community? How can we use storytelling as a vehicle to bring change to the unequal and unethical systems around technology? How can we create stories that reveal these complex questions through engaging narrative?</p>
